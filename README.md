This is my first ever python script. I had a lot of help from the interent :).
But I got it finished!

The idea was that I wanted to start learning to solve some problems which I think is what drives most engineers to make anything, and since I was having such a hard time figuring out what to make and it be orginal I turned to my life.
I figured I could look for a problem or task that python could solve or do, and that was creating a report from a website. I would I have to navigate to a page and click these data entries in a massive table, and after I clicked each entry or row
i would have to copy and paste all the data into a google sheet to email to my boss. 

I knew python could web scrape with the right libraries so I decided that was. It started by using selenium to just copy the text and pasting the string into a dictionary that I could use pandas to make an excel file out of.
But then selenium and the website I was scraping began having problems. So I turned to JavaScript playwright which defeated the whole purpose of using python. However I wanted a project done. Long story short that was a waste of time,
because I wanted to playwright to just capture the XHR response from my browser that gave the data entries their values. I thought playwright was a JavaScript only library, but poof I found a python version. 

That is this creation here. It isnt perfect but it works and the site I am scraping isnt the fastest and most stable so I am pretty proud of my self. I was going to keep it as just a script I would run in vscode or something. But that meant 
the project was IMCOMPLETE? That cant happen on my watch ....

So I made a GUI for it so I could compile it into a desktop app, or well any win system that can run python and has chrome.
I actaully made it into a app because I knew I may need it at work or while out of town. I didnt want to be in my Chick-Fil-A meetings running code from my IDE lookin like a dorky lil hacker.
Even though the UI looks like a 2000's application installer. 

In the end its done and its my first big python project, that is kinda complete, which is miles better than any of uncomplete portfolios ....
